## ⚠️ Data Integrity Issues Found

### **Issue #1: Work Orders Missing Vessel Associations** 🔴 MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Problem:** All 19 work orders have `NULL` vessel_id  
**Impact:**

- Cannot filter work orders by vessel
- Vessel dashboards won't show work orders
- Fleet-level reporting incomplete

**Recommendation:**

```sql
-- Fix: Associate work orders with vessels based on equipment
UPDATE work_orders wo
SET vessel_id = e.vessel_id
FROM equipment e
WHERE wo.equipment_id = e.id
  AND e.vessel_id IS NOT NULL;
```

### **Issue #2: No Device Registry Data** 🟡 LOW PRIORITY

**Problem:** 0 devices in device_registry table  
**Impact:**

- Device monitoring features not utilized
- Edge device telemetry tracking incomplete

**Recommendation:** If you have edge devices sending telemetry, register them in the device_registry table for full visibility.

### **Issue #3: No DTC Faults Recorded** 🟡 LOW PRIORITY

**Problem:** 0 active DTC (Diagnostic Trouble Code) faults  
**Impact:**

- DTC monitoring not operational
- J1939 fault code features unused

**Recommendation:** If marine equipment supports J1939/J1708 protocols, configure DTC polling to capture diagnostic codes.

### **Issue #4: No Crew Assignments** 🟡 LOW PRIORITY

**Problem:** 0 crew assignments in crew_assignment table  
**Impact:**

- Crew scheduling features not active
- STCW Hours of Rest compliance not tracked

**Recommendation:** If using crew scheduling, populate crew and crew_assignment tables.

---

## 🔧 Configuration Recommendations

### **1. Unresolved Sync Conflicts** 🟠 ACTION REQUIRED

**Current State:** 2 safety-critical conflicts pending resolution

- `sensor_configurations.threshold`: 95 vs 85
- `sensor_configurations.max_temp`: 120 vs 110

**Action:** Use the Conflict Resolution UI to manually select values:

1. Click "Data Sync" in sidebar
2. Select preferred values (local or server)
3. Click "Resolve Conflicts"

### **2. Equipment Without Vessels** 🟢 MINOR

**Current State:** 3 equipment items have no vessel assignment  
**Action:** Assign these to vessels for better organization
