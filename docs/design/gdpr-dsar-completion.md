# Design proposal — completing GDPR DSAR (access + erasure)

Status: **erasure DRAFTED against this design (see `executeDataErasure` in
`server/db/gdpr/db-gdpr.ts`); the per-table policy below still needs a
compliance owner's sign-off, and a `dryRun` should be run on staging before the
endpoint is relied on.** Access-export completion (§1) remains open.

## Erasure — what the draft does (vs. this design)

`executeDataErasure(dsarId, orgId, erasedBy, reason, { dryRun })` now:

- resolves the subject from the DSAR (`requesterId`/`requesterEmail`),
- **anonymizes** identifying PII on `users` (name/email/username/phone) and
  `crew` (name/email/phone/address/photo/emergency-contact/crew-code/notes) in
  a single transaction,
- **retains** `immutable_audit_trail` (hash-chained — modifying breaks chain
  verification), `crew_rest_sheet` (STCW retention), and `work_orders`
  (operational retention) — they reference the now-anonymized ids,
- returns a per-table **report**, and (non-dry-run) sets the DSAR
  `status = 'completed'` with the report in `processing_notes`.
- `POST /dsar/:id/execute-erasure` accepts `dryRun: true` (preview, no confirm
  needed) and still requires `confirmErasure: true` for a real run.

**Sign-off checklist before enabling:** confirm the table policy map below
(which additional tables hold subject PII? any that must be hard-deleted rather
than anonymized?), and run `dryRun` against staging to confirm match counts.

The DSAR (data-subject access request) handling in `server/db/gdpr/db-gdpr.ts`
is partial scaffolding. The **clear bugs** were fixed directly (wrong `crew`
table name in collection; a null-identifier guard at the route — see git
history). The two items below change behaviour in compliance- and
retention-sensitive ways, so they are proposed here rather than implemented
unilaterally.

## 1. Complete the access export (Art. 15)

`collectUserDataForDsar(orgId, identifier, identifierType)` declares five result
categories but only populates `users` + `crewMembers`. It must also populate
`workOrders`, `restRecords`, `auditEvents`, and resolve the subject across id
types. Proposed subject→data mapping (confirm the linking keys with the data
owner):

| Category    | Table                           | Link to subject                                                                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| users       | `users`                         | `id` (userId) / `email`                                                           |
| crewMembers | `crew`                          | `id` (crewId) / `email`                                                           |
| workOrders  | `work_orders`                   | `assigned_crew_id` = crewId; (decide: also `completed_by`/`created_by` = userId?) |
| restRecords | crew rest table (`crew_rest_*`) | `crew_id` = crewId                                                                |
| auditEvents | `immutable_audit_trail`         | actor/`user_id` = userId                                                          |

Also fix the id-type dispatch: today the crew lookup runs `... WHERE email = ?`
for _any_ non-`crewId` type (so a `userId` is queried against the crew email
column). Dispatch should be: `crewId` → crew by id; `email` → users+crew by
email; `userId` → users by id, then resolve the linked crew id. Replace the
broad `try/catch {}` that swallows all errors with per-source error capture so a
failed source is reported, not silently dropped.

## 2. Erasure (Art. 17) — the hard part

`executeDataErasure` currently marks the DSAR `status: "completed"` /
`"erasure_recorded"` but **deletes nothing**. That misrepresents compliance.
Two coupled decisions are needed:

**(a) Status truthfulness (do first, low risk):** until real erasure exists, the
endpoint must NOT report `completed`. Use a truthful state (e.g.
`pending_manual_review`) and a response that says erasure is not yet performed.

**(b) Erase vs. anonymize, per table:** maritime data has **legal retention**
requirements that conflict with deletion:

- `immutable_audit_trail` is append-only + hash-chained — it **cannot** be
  deleted without breaking the chain. → **anonymize** the actor identity
  (replace name/email with a tombstone), keep the record.
- STCW rest-hour records, completed work orders, certificates — likely subject
  to **statutory retention** → **anonymize** PII fields, retain the operational
  record.
- Free-PII tables with no retention basis (e.g. contact/profile rows) →
  **hard-delete**.

Proposed shape: a per-table policy map `{ table → delete | anonymize | retain }`,
executed in a single transaction, producing an erasure **report**
(what was deleted / anonymized / retained-with-reason). DSAR status becomes
`completed_with_retention_exemptions` (+ the report stored on the request).

## Why this isn't auto-implemented

Choosing delete-vs-anonymize per table, and which tables are retention-exempt,
is a legal/compliance call — getting it wrong either leaks PII (under-erasure)
or destroys legally-required records (over-erasure). Sign off the table policy
map above, then implementation is mechanical.
