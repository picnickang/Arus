### ⚠️ AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT

1. **Test Schema Alignment:** Some test files need schema updates to match current database
2. **Crew Data:** Test org has no crew (limits crew testing)
3. **Parts Inventory:** Test org has no parts (limits inventory testing)
4. **E2E UI Tests:** Cannot run Playwright tests due to external access limitations

## Production Readiness Assessment

### Current State: ✅ READY FOR INTERNAL/DEVELOPMENT USE

**Strengths:**

- ✅ Multi-tenant security validated
- ✅ Data integrity confirmed
- ✅ Core workflows functional
