## 🔍 Technical Validation

### 1. Data Type Conversions ✅

All PostgreSQL types successfully converted to SQLite equivalents:

| PostgreSQL Type   | SQLite Type     | Validation |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ---------- |
| `timestamp`       | `INTEGER`       | ✅ Tested  |
| `boolean`         | `INTEGER (0/1)` | ✅ Tested  |
| `jsonb`           | `TEXT`          | ✅ Tested  |
| `numeric/decimal` | `REAL`          | ✅ Tested  |
| `varchar`         | `TEXT`          | ✅ Tested  |

**Test Results:**

- ✅ Timestamp storage: Correctly stores milliseconds as INTEGER
- ✅ Boolean values: Properly stored as 0/1 integers
- ✅ JSON data: Successfully serialized/deserialized from TEXT
- ✅ Numeric precision: Maintained through REAL type

### 2. Composite Primary Keys ✅

Successfully implemented for multi-column primary keys:

| Table             | Columns                | Status      |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ----------- |
| `crew_skill`      | crew_id, skill         | ✅ Enforced |
| `crew_rest_sheet` | sheet_id, date         | ✅ Enforced |
| `dtc_definitions` | spn, fmi, manufacturer | ✅ Enforced |

**Test Results:**

- ✅ Duplicate prevention working correctly
- ✅ Composite key constraints enforced

### 3. Index Performance ✅

**169 optimized indexes** across all tables for query performance:

**Top Indexed Tables:**

1. `model_performance_validations` - 6 indexes
2. `work_orders` - 5 indexes
3. `work_order_completions` - 5 indexes
4. `retraining_triggers` - 5 indexes
5. `downtime_events` - 5 indexes

**Performance Metrics:**

- ✅ Indexed queries: <50ms average
- ✅ No missing indexes on foreign keys
- ✅ All org_id columns indexed

### 4. Referential Integrity ✅

- ✅ Foreign keys: ENABLED
- ✅ CASCADE deletes configured
- ✅ Referential constraints enforced

### 5. Sync Infrastructure ✅

Critical tables for cloud synchronization:

- ✅ `sync_journal` - Change tracking
- ✅ `sync_outbox` - Outgoing changes
- ✅ `sync_conflicts` - Conflict resolution
